        <p class="pbody">RecruitChute's mission is to provide the tools and guidance necessary to assist prospective college soccer players 
        throughout the recruitment journey from start to finish. If you have the drive, we have the tools and don't let anyone 
        tell you you're not good enough. Soccer is the number one growing sport in the US and for good reason - Soccer is awesome! 
        Here at RecruitChute, we live and breathe soccer in our daily lives, all members of our team have played at least high school 
        soccer so we like to think we know a thing or two about how this process works! </p>

        <h2 class="section">Our Philosophy</h2>
        <p class="pbody">Here at RecruitChute we have always had the firm belief that when it comes to athletic recruiting, the more proactive you 
        can be, the better. College coaches want to deal with athletes directly, not their parents or middle-men. The best way to 
        market yourself effectively to college coaches is to do exactly that, market YOURSELF. We provide the tools that allow YOU to 
        make it happen.

                should be given the opportunity to play college soccer as it is such a once in a lifetime experience.  I 
                founded RecruitChute to give every soccer player in this country the best chance of living their dream out of playing 
                college soccer – and if you get the shot, take it. To this day, I still have a strong relationship with all my old 
                teammates, current teammates and coaching staff because of the unbreakable bond that was formed throughout my four-year 
                collegiate soccer career.”

        <p class="pbody">RecruitChute was founded by Manchester, England native Christopher Roche who was recruited over to play college soccer 
        over in Wisconsin. As a life-time Manchester United fan, he considers himself to know a thing or two about the sport and has 
        been implementing his soccer theories and style of play throughout his coaching career. Now in the college recruiting industry, 
        Chris is revolutionizing the way that high school athletes and college coaches interact and communicate. </p>
